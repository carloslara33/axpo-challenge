# ADR 1: Use of Create-react-app

## Context
As the application is for a code test, agility in creating the application scaffolding is sought.

## Decision
I have decided to use this tool offered by React to speed up the initial process.

## Consequences
- **Benefits**: Speeds up development time, easy initial setup.
- **Risks**: Could bring problems if the application needed to grow significantly, configuration could become difficult.

# ADR 2: Use of Material UI component library

## Context
As the application is for a code test and agility is sought, this library offers all kinds of basic components that facilitate the development process.

## Decision
I have decided to use this library for all the basic components of the app.

## Consequences
- **Benefits**: Accelerates development time, many components out of the box.
- **Disadvantages**: Growth in package size due to the use of the library.
- **Risks**: Adding libraries always carries the risk that they stop being updated and could cause issues with new versions of others.

# ADR 3: Routing, file-based routing or standard

## Context
When deciding what type of routing architecture to use, these two options typically come up: standard routing with routes and a router, and file-based routing as used by Next.js.

## Decision
I have chosen to use the standard to avoid complicating the initial code of the application with all the logic that needs to be added to make file-routing work. If the application were larger, I would have opted for file-based due to the ease and intuitiveness it provides in generating new routes.

## Consequences
- **Benefits**: Standard router, any developer knows how to configure it and add more routes, it doesnâ€™t have a complex initial setup.
- **Risks**: If the app grows significantly, it could become cumbersome to manage so many routes in the router.

# ADR 4: AgGrid, Dynamic table

## Context
I need to add a table that displays data and updates it quickly.

## Decision
I have used AgGrid because it is a very flexible library with many solved problems and it is also well-known.

## Consequences
- **Benefits**: Covers many use cases.
- **Disadvantages**: It is complex to configure in its more complex use cases.
- **Risks**: The price of the enterprise could rise even more and make it inaccessible for the company.
